# lit-element-context state manager

It supposed to be a simple context provider but somehow it became a store ðŸª¦

It's a simple state manager for lit-element. I needed something like redux, but something less complicated. It implements a store, and provides a method to set and update properties in the store.

On every property update, the components get a new data injected into them through props, and as we know, components are rerendered if the properties are changed.

you can find a working example in the `test/components` folder.


## New features

Version 1.0.5
- [x] actions and async actions
- [x] setProps method to set multiple values at the same time

## Usage

init the context where ever you want

```javascript
import context from 'lit-element-simple-context';

context.init({propName: someval, propName2: {nestedData: []} });
```

connect a lit component to the context
```javascript
import { LitElement } from 'lit';
import context from 'lit-element-simple-context';

class MyLitComponent extends LitElement {}

window.customElements.define('my-lit-component', context.connect(MyLitComponent));
```

specify the props you need from context in your component
```javascript
class MyLitComponent extends LitElement {
  static get properties() {
    return {
      somepropFromContext: {type: Number},
      renamedProp: {type: String}
    }
  }

  static get propsFromContext() {
    return {
      somepropFromContext: 'somepropFromContext',
      somepropFromContext2: 'renamedProp'
    };
  }
}
```

change a value in the store once the component is connected to the store
```javascript
this.setProp('somepropFromContext2', 0);
```

change a value in the store if the component is not connected to the store
```javascript
import context from 'lit-element-simple-context';

context.setProp('someprop', context.state.someprop + 1);
```

You can use actions (and async actions as well) instead of `setProp` method calls.

```javascript 
// actions.js
import context from 'lit-element-simple-context';

export const incrementBy = context.action((state, value) => ({someprop: state.someprop + value}));

export const asyncAction = context.asyncAction(async (_, value1, value2) => ({ value1, value2}));


// some-other-file.js
import { asyncAction, incrementBy } from './actions.js';

async function foo() {
  await asyncAction('foo', 'bar');

  incrementBy(1);
}
```

that's it!! there is no need of tons of boilerplate code and every component gets the fresh data on change.

## Testing with Web Test Runner
To run the suite of Web Test Runner tests, run
```bash
yarn test
```

To run the tests in watch mode 

```bash
yarn test:watch
```

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.

## Local Demo with `web-dev-server`
```bash
yarn start
```
To run a local development server that serves the basic demo located in `demo/index.html`
